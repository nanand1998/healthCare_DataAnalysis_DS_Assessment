# healthCare_DataAnalysis_DS_Assessment
The Healthcare Risk Assessment repository is a web application designed to assess an individual's risk for certain medical conditions based on their gender and blood group. I worked on it as a part of Assessment  for Dasault Systemes 'Data Analyst' role.

1. Here I imported the healthcare_data to perform analysis on the data using python

2. Here I formed a crosstable containing relation between Gender, Blood Group Type and Medical Condition

3. Here I plotted the co-relation of gender, blood Group type and the medical Conditon in a heatmap for graphic visualization

4. Finding out the Average billing amount using groupby function to aggregate the billing amount for each Medical Condition.

5. From here the data I prepared that can be used as a training data for my web application

6. Exported the training data as 'medical_condition_risk.csv'

Web Application using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, CSV file as database

Here The CSV file is generated as a backend store for users with user data appended everytime in the CSV file everytime a new user presses the submit button.
