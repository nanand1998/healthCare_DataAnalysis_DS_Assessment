# healthCare_DataAnalysis_DS_Assessment
The Healthcare Risk Assessment repository is a web application designed to assess an individual's risk for certain medical conditions based on their gender and blood group. I worked on it as a part of Assessment  for Dasault Systemes 'Data Analyst' role.

1. Here I imported the healthcare_data to perform analysis on the data using python

2. Here I formed a crosstable containing relation between Gender, Blood Group Type and Medical Condition

3. Here I plotted the co-relation of gender, blood Group type and the medical Conditon in a heatmap for graphic visualization

4. Finding out the Average billing amount for each medical condition using groupby function to aggregate the billing amount for each Medical Condition.

5. From here the data I prepared that can be used as a training data for my web application

6. Exported the training data as 'medical_condition_risk.csv'
